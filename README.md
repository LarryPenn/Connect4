# Connect4

This is a simple Connect 4 game, with two players and one board that is a 6*7 array. 
The two players take turn dropping a disc to the board, until there is a winner or the board is full.
The main methods include 1) testing if there's a winner; 2) testing if the board is full; 3) testing if a move is legal, and 4) printing out the board. These are all in the board class to make the program cohesive. 
Ideally, I'd like to build a GUI to make method 4) above more visually appealing. Due to time constraint, I wasn't able to put together a functional GUI, so the output of this program is a simple two dimensional array in the Eclipse console. This is certainly an area of improvement that could be addressed in future versions. 
Otherwise, hopefully the program is self explanatory and easy to navigate!
